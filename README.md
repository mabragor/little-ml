Tiny library of machine learning techniques discussed in Andrew Ng's course
on coursera (and hence it's my attempt to actually understand that course).

TODO:
  * linear regression of one variable
  * graphical demo of linear regression of one variable
    * make new points on 2d graph, button "learn" starts learning
    * interactive addition/erasure of new points, line dynamically fits.
  * multidimensional linear regression
  * logistic regression
  * neural networks
  * recommender systems
  * and whatnot!
